-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< EXAMPLE >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- TODO: Remove the "--" from the below SELECT query and run the query
--    NOTE: When writing queries, make sure each one ends with a semi-colon

SELECT * FROM final_airbnb;

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 1 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find out how many rows are in the table "final_airbnb"
-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 146

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM final_airbnb;

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 2 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find out the name of the host for "host_id" 63613
-- HINT: "Where" could it be?

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: Patricia

SELECT host_name 
FROM final_airbnb
WHERE host_id = 63613;

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 3 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Query the data to just show the unique neighbourhoods listed
-- HINT: This is a "distinct" operation...

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 40 neighbourhoods listed

SELECT DISTINCT neighbourhood
FROM final_airbnb;

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 4 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

-- Find both the highest price listing and the lowest price listing, displaying the entire row for each
-- HINT: This can be two different queries.

-- FOOD FOR THOUGHT: Think about the results. Are the high and low prices outliers in this data set?

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: Highest = 785, Lowest = 55

SELECT MIN(price), MAX(price)
FROM final_airbnb;

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 5 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find the average availability for all listings in the data set (using the availability_365 column)
-- HINT: Aggregates are more than just big rocks...

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 165.3904

SELECT AVG(availability_365)
FROM final_airbnb;

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 6 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find all listings that do NOT have a review
-- HINT: There are a few ways to go about this. Remember that an empty cell is "no value", but not necessarily NULL

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 6 rows

SELECT *
FROM final_airbnb
WHERE number_of_reviews = 0;

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 7 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find the id of the listing with a room_type of "Private room" that has the most reviews 
-- HINT: Sorting is your friend!

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 58059

-- realized after the fact that I didn't include Private Room as a parameter, but the result is the same
SELECT id, room_type, number_of_reviews
FROM final_airbnb
ORDER BY number_of_reviews DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 8 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find the most popular neighbourhood for listings 
-- HINT: Look for which neighbourhood appears most frequently in the neighbourhood column
-- HINT: You are creating "summary rows" for each neighbourhood, so you will just see one entry for each neighbourhood

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: Williamsburg
-- INVESTIGATE: Should Williamsburg be crowned the most popular neighbourhood?
	-- Williamsburg having the most airbnb properties doesn't necessarily correlate to it being the most popular neighborhood.
	-- Determining the most popular neighborhood would probably require looking more at occupancy/reviews compared with availability. 
	-- This is just measuring availability.

SELECT neighbourhood
FROM final_airbnb
GROUP BY neighbourhood
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 9 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Query the data to discover which listing is the most popular using the reviews_per_month for all listings with a minimum_nights value of less than 7
-- HINT: Sorting is still your friend! So are constraints.

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 58059

SELECT id
FROM final_airbnb
WHERE minimum_nights < 7
ORDER BY number_of_reviews DESC
LIMIT 1;


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 10 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find out which host has the most listings. 
-- Create a NEW column that will show a calculation for how many listings the host for each listing has in the table
-- Display the column using aliasing.
-- HINT: Work this one step at a time. See if you can find a way to just display the count of listings per host first.

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: The Box House Hotel with 6 listings

SELECT host_name, COUNT(host_name) as number_of_listings
FROM final_airbnb
GROUP BY host_name
ORDER BY number_of_listings DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 11 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< WRAP UP >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- What do you think makes a successful AirBnB rental in this market? What factors seem to be at play the most?
-- Write a few sentences and include them with your project submission in the README file 

	-- A successful airbnb rental is consistently booked, consistently reviewed, in a desirable and accessible area.
	-- There is not necessarily a perfect airbnb but tracking those factors consistently and adjusting based on your findings
	-- will help yield a consistently successful listing.

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ** BONUS ** >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find the the percent above or below each listing is compared to the average price for all listings.
-- HINT: No hints! It's a bonus for a reason :)

SELECT id, price, (price - (SELECT AVG(price) FROM final_airbnb))/(SELECT AVG(price) FROM final_airbnb) * 100 as percentage_above_or_below_avg_price
FROM final_airbnb
GROUP BY id, price;
